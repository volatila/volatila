## Hi there, I'm volatila 👋

I'm a 16-year-old developer and creator known as **Volatila**—a fusion of `volatile` and `lolita`. As a coder and, my work ranges from intricate Minecraft physics engines to system-level integrations.

🔧 **What I build:**
- 🚀 High-performance memory allocators like **VlHeap**.
- 🧊 Physics systems such as **BulletX** - a GPU-accelerated Bullet extension.
- 🎮 Creative Minecraft plugins: **FluentUI**, a pure-server-side animated UI library, including effects like "fade-in-out, interpolation".
- 🖥️ Pure server-side ray tracing without client mods.
- 🔥 Innovative frameworks like **FNI (Fast Native Interface)**, boosting Java-C++ interactions significantly.
- 🎵 Real-time Song Request System via Bilibili Live Danmaku.

✨ **Technologies I love:**
- Java, Kotlin, C++, C#, and OpenCL
- Native integration and extreme performance optimization
- Artisic Creation
