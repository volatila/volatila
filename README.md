## Hi there, I'm volatila 👋

I'm a 16 year old developer and creator going by the stage name **Volatila** - a portmanteau of "volatile" and "lolita". I specialize in **experimental development** and **high-performance systems development**.

🔧 **What I build:**
- 🚀 High-performance memory allocators like **VlHeap**.
- 🧊 Physics systems such as **BulletX** - a GPU-accelerated Bullet extension.
- 🎮 Creative Minecraft plugins: **FluentUI**, a pure-server-side animated UI library, including effects like "fade-in-out, interpolation".
- 🖥️ Pure server-side ray tracing without client mods.
- 🔥 Innovative frameworks like **FNI (Fast Native Interface)**, boosting Java-C++ interactions significantly.
- 🎵 Real-time Song Request System via Bilibili Live Danmaku.

## 🌙 About me
My name is Volatila, a fusion of "volatile" and "lolita" —
My Original character about myself as a Neko who refuses to grow up, obsessively clinging to an innocent, fragile form.  Personality is complex and unpredictable.
`A manic obsession with code, an extreme devotion to performance.`

✨ **Technologies I love:**
- Java, Kotlin, C++, C#, and OpenCL
- Native integration and extreme performance optimization
- Artisic Creation
